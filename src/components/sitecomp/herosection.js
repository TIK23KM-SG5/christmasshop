        <h1>Welcome to our Holly Christmas Shop</h1>
        <p>It all began in the year 2023 when a group of students started</p>
        <p>wondering what it would be like to start a business together.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>This journey has been exciting with many obstacles and those have now been turned into</p>
        <p>this beautiful Christmas Shop where you can adventure and find your inner Christmas elf.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>Enjoy and have a Merry Christmas!</p>
